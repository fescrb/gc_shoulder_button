# GameCube Shoulder Button

This project's aim is to create a model & CAD files of a GameCube shoulder button. 

A 1:1 correspondance is not required. A simple 3D printable model that can be inserted in the hole for the shoulder button and action it in a similar fashion is all that is required.

After the first objective is achieved. The aim is to parameterize travel times for shoulder button activation/deactivation and change them.
