# Progress

# Test 1:

The narrow corner is too big to fit the hole in the controller. Will narrow it down.

# Test 2:

Didn't quite get the top smooth but I did manage to fit the button in the controller.

The clips to attach the spring base are too flimsy at 0.5mm length, I will increase it to 1.5mm and increase the size of the hole that keeps the metal in place.
